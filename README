An IRC/Campfire bridge written in Scala using the spray-io framework.

The name Gertie is inspired by the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows bridge from the 40's. The bridge collapsed 4 months after completion, earning the nickname, "Galloping Gertie".

Hopefully this bridge is more stable :)

This project depends on bivouac, https://github.com/fooblahblah/bivouac.Install bivouac locally using the following (from bivouac):

$ sbt publish-local

Afterward, bivouac should resolve in the gertie project.

To create an executable image:

$ ./release.sh

This will create an executable named gertie in the current directory.
