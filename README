An IRC/Campfire bridge written in Scala using the spray-io framework.

The name Gertie is inspired by the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows bridge from the 40's. The bridge collapsed 4 months after completion, earning the nickname, "Galloping Gertie".

Hopefully this bridge is more stable :)

To create an executable image:

$ ./release.sh

This will create an executable named gertie in the current directory.

To run:

$ ./gertie

 or

$ sbt run
